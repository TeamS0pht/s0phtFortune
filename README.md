# TeamPhrases

This is a near pointless project, but I got a bit bored on new years, not sorry. It's a little python method and yml file to create random team related nonsense, I intend to import it into other tools over time, under some ASCII art because this is roughly 'on my level'. Use sadnwich mode to freeze the config by creating a portable, config-less version if you like. 

It's in Git so that anyone can add their pointless phrases if they want. No pressure.
